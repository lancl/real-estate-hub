# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I decided Not to update my repo from 2018, instead start a new repo via create-react-app. Because the effort to update the legacy codes is too high, with some examples as below.

- The npm modules can no longer be installed properly with my current version of node (v14, VS previously at v8).
- Even with node at v8 (before my update), the module csvtojson stopped working due to some conflit. The failing of a key module is a major blocker.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
