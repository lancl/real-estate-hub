# Real Estate Hub

About the app: it is a real-estate hub, providing insights such as home-price trend in the United States.

## A Bootstrapped App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I decided Not to update my repo from 2018 (via webpack). Instead, I started a new repo via create-react-app. Because the effort to update the legacy codes is too high, including the following:

- The npm modules can no longer be installed properly with my current version of node (v14, VS previously at v8).
- Even with node at v8 (before my update), the module csvtojson stopped working due to some conflit. The failing of a key module is a major blocker.

## Database decision: MongoDB

## Development

- Install dependencies: `npm start`
- Run the app: `npm start`; then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. Also, any lint errors will be shown in the console.
